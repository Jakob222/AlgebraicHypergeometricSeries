# AlgebraicHypergeometricSeries
An algorithm which determines for given parameters a,b,c whether the gaussian hypergeometric function Hypergeometric2F1[a,b,c,x] is algebraic. Implemented in Mathematica.
For the algorithm to work copy the file "Algorithm.m" into one of the directories in $Path and then execute "<< AlgHypAlgorithm.m". 
Tested for Mathematica 12.1
